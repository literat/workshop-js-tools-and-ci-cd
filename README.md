# Tools and automatization in Javascript

Mainly based on experience of my former college Riky Fridrich ([@fczbkk](https://github.com/fczbkk)) and his [JS Tools Workshop](https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/kurzy/nastroje-javascriptu).

Upgraded with my own JS development experience and used for internal workshops and trainings.
